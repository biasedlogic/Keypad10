# Keypad10
A simple external keypad based on Arduino Micro Pro / ATMega32u4, emulates HID Keyboard and is intended to use with Open Broadcaster Studio (OBS)

# Components

For my implementation I used:
1x Arduino Pro Micro (ATMega 32u4) board
10x Cherry MX switches of your choice (LED option) or compatible mechanically
12x 3mm LEDs in color of your choice
3 universal screws 9mm long, 3.5mm diameter, flat head
Some wire, solder, etc.

Arduino code is provided.
STL files for a housing to hold 10 MX switches and an Arduino board as well.
